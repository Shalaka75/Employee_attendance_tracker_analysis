# Employee_attendance_leave_tracker_analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing employee attendance and leave data using Python (Pandas).
The goal is to clean, process, and analyze attendance records to gain meaningful insights such as employee presence, absences, leave patterns, and overall workforce trends.

This project demonstrates data preprocessing, data wrangling, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) skills that are essential for a Data Analyst role.

Analyze leave patterns across employees

Identify employees with high absenteeism

Calculate working days, present days, and leave counts

Generate summary reports for HR or management
